- [x] Programming Fundamentals

- [x] Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C

- [x] Pointers, Arrays, and Recursion

- [x] Interacting with the System and Managing Memory


Quite a good course! 😆 Despite being an introductory course, I still made a dozen of bugs and learned a lot from them. Thanks to this course, I now have a better understanding of pointers and memory, and I can confidently use gdb and valgrind.🥰 By the way, the workload turned out to be larger than I expected, I spent around 80 hours on it. 🤍
